Readme for Final Project- Web Development 1. Building on Project 7(About Me) web page by adding my own additional content & styling. 
Created using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and notepad for this Readme file. 
There will be a seperate Bootstrap version in a seperate repo which I hope to adsd Angular &/or React programming to as well. 
The Final Project is the culmination of what I have learned in this class with the tutelage of Professor Teeters. 
The basis of this website draws on inspiration from my incredible super-hero son, Finnegan. 
He is extremely photogenic and basically a ham.
